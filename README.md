## SQL & Data Analysis

This repository contains my solutions to **BDA Assignment**, split into two main problems.

### Problem 1 — Chinook Database (30 pts)

* **Language/Tools:** SQL (PostgreSQL)
* **Description:** Ten queries on the Chinook sample database to practice key SQL concepts: filtering, joins, grouping, aggregations, and ranking.
* **File:** `Problem 1 Assignment 3.sql`

### Problem 2 — PostgreSQL Dataset Analysis (70 pts)

* **Language/Tools:** PostgreSQL for data retrieval, Python (pandas, matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook) for analysis and visualization.
* **Description:** A complete PostgreSQL-compatible database was chosen, loaded into Postgres, and analyzed. The notebook contains:

  * A thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plain-language storytelling and insights.
  * One additional analysis/modeling task with interpretation of results.
* **File:** `Problem 2 Assignment 3.ipynb`

### How to run

1. Set up PostgreSQL locally.
2. Load the Chinook database (for Problem 1) and your chosen PostgreSQL dataset (for Problem 2).
3. Execute the SQL file or open the notebook to reproduce the results.
